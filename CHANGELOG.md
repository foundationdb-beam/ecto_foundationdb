# Changelog

## v0.5.0 (2025-07-08)

### Enhancements

* `EctoFoundationDB.CLI` [[doc](operators_manual.md)]: Functions for an operator to use to safely manage
data migrations that cannot be done automatically.
* Index Metadata [[doc](metadata.html)] now makes use of FoundationDB's `\xff/metadataVersion` key,
which allows the client to cache metadata and maintain transactional isolation
without having to wait on any keys. Also, the cache is shared across all open tenants of the same id on a given node.
* `EctoFoundationDB.Versionstamp` [[doc](Ecto.Adapters.FoundationDB.html#module-versionstamps-autoincrement)]: Added the ability to insert objects with a monotonically increasing integer id, via FoundationDB's versionstamp.
* `SchemaMetadata` [[doc](Ecto.Adapters.FoundationDB.html#module-schema-metadata)]: This is a new built-in Indexer that allows your app to watch and sync collection of objects in a tenant.
* Added ability to drop an index.

### Breaking changes

* Key construction has changed, making databases created on <= 0.4.x incompatible with >=0.5. Specifically, a binary, atom, or
  number primary key is now encoded in the FDB key with the Tuple layer. All other types remain encoded with term_to_binary.
  If you need help upgrading your database, please put in a GitHub Issue. We strive for a stable v1.0.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where index creation was failing for multikey objects
* (#57) Fixed a bug where index management was failing while a new index was being created

### Deprecations

* Ecto has deprecated `Repo.transaction` in favor of `Repo.transact`. Since this decision doesn't align with FoundationDB's view of
transactions, we have chosen to deprecate `Repo.transaction` in favor of `Repo.transactional`. This terminology better aligns with
`:erlfdb` and provides a distinction from RDBMS transactions, and allows us to avoid future deprecations.

### New documentation

* [Guide for Operators](operators_manual.html): Describes how to use the `EctoFoundationDB.CLI` functions to rename a field while guaraneeting that all
concurrent queries in your distributed application are successful.
* [Metadata Design](metadata.html): Describes how index metadata is managed and cached in EctoFDB.
* [Sync Engine Part I - Single Object](watches.livemd): Revamped Livebook that demonstrates how to create a Sync Engine for a single object (for syncing reads)
* [Sync Engine Part II - Collections](collection_syncing.livemd): New Livebook that demonstrates a Sync Engine for a collection of objects in a tenant (still for reads)

## v0.4.0 (2025-01-16)

### Enhancements

* [Large Structs](Ecto.Adapters.FoundationDB.html#module-advanced-options): If your struct encodes to a size larger than 100,000 Bytes, it will now be split across several FDB key-values automatically.
  Previously, EctoFDB did not attempt to detect this and allowed FoundationDB to throw error code 2103: "value_too_large - Value length exceeds limit".
  See documentation for configuration options.
* `EctoFoundationDB.Sandbox` now uses `m:erlfdb_sandbox`. Sandbox directory name is now `.erlfdb_sandbox`. Directories named `.erlfdb` should be removed.

### Bug fixes

* Upgrade erlfdb to v0.2.2

## v0.3.1 (2024-10-24)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed consistency issue with index updates. Previously, the old index key was still queryable.
* Fixed write amplification issue when updating struct's non-indexed fields.

### New Documentation

* Added `fdb_api_counting_text.exs` which tests and documents the `:erlfdb` operations that our Layer is expected to make.

## v0.3.0 (2024-10-20)

### \*\* Major breaking changes \*\*

Databases that have been created using a prior version of EctoFoundationDB will be broken on
EctoFDB v0.3 and above. Please start a new database with EctoFDB v0.3. If you currently have
a database on v0.2 or earlier, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/foundationdb-beam/ecto_foundationdb/issues)
to discuss the upgrade path.

### Enhancements

* [Watches](Ecto.Adapters.FoundationDB.html#module-watches): Support for FDB Watches, which is like a database-driven PubSub on an Ecto struct.
* [Directory Tenants](EctoFoundationDB.Tenant.html): A new default backend for Multitenancy that is production-ready. Managed tenants have been moved to "Experimental" status.
* `@schema_context usetenant: true` is no longer required.
* The `:open_db` option now defines a 1-arity function that accepts the Repo module.
